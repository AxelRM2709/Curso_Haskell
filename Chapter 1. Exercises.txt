Chapter 1. Exercises

1.-Give another possible calculation for the result of double (double 2)

double (double (double 1))
=double (double (1+1)) {applying the firts double}
=double (double 2)
=double (2+2) {applying the second double}
=double 4
=4+4 {applying the third one}
=8

2.-Show that sum[x]=x for any number x
sum[x] = x + sum[] {by definition}
= x + 0 = x

3.- Define a function product that produces the product of a list of numbers, and show using your definition that product[2,3,4]=24

product[] = 1
product[x:xs] = x * product[xs]

product[2,3,4]= 2 * product[3,4]
=2 * (3 * product[4])
=2 * (3 * (4 * product[]))
=2 * (3 * (4 * 1))
=24

4.- How should the definition of the function qsort be modified so that it produces a reverse sorted version of a list

qsort[] = []
qsort[x:xs] = qsort[xs] ++ [x]

Example:
qsort[1,2,3]= qsort[2,3] ++ [1]
=(qsort[3] ++ [2]) ++ [1]
=((qsort[] ++ [3]) ++ [2]) ++ [1]
=[3,2,1]

5.- What would be the effect of replacing <= by < in the original definition of qsort?

Repeating list elements would be removed.
