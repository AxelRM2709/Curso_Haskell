Chapter 2. Exercises

2.- Parenthesise the following numeric expressions:

 a) 2^3*4.    (2^3)*4
 b) 2*3+4*5.  (2*3)+(4*5)
 c) 2+3*4^5.  2+(3*(4^5))

3.- The script below contains three syntactic errors. Correct this erros and then check that your script Works properly using GHCI.

n = a `div` length xs  -- name must begin with a lower-case
 where                 -- must not use tabs
  a = 10               -- each definition at the same level must begin in the same column
  xs = [1,2,3,4,5]     

4.- The library function last selects the last element of a non-empty list. Show how the function last could be defined in terms of the library functions introduced in this chapter.

last xs = head (reverse xs)
last xs = xs !! (length xs - 1)

5.- The library function init removes the last element from a non-empty list. Show how init could smilarly be defined in two diffent ways.

init xs = take (length xs - 1) xs
init xs = reverse (drop 1 (revere xs)) -- we can use tail instead drop 1 but it throws an error in a empty list
